# Understanding Encryption: A Brief Overview
## Introduction
Encryption is a mathematical algorithm that must be rigorously adhered to in order to ensure data protection. While not everyone needs to understand the mathematical intricacies behind encryption, a basic comprehension is essential as encryption has become a critical control measure to safeguard data in today's digital age. This article aims to provide an overview of the fundamental operations and types of Encryptions, as well as addressing specific encryption methods and concepts.

## Basic Operations in General Encryption
Encryption relies on a few basic operations to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa. These operations include:
* XOR (Exclusive OR): A bitwise operation that is fundamental in many encryption algorithms. It combines bits in a way that if both bits are the same, the result is 0; otherwise, the result is 1.
*	Substitution: Replacing each element of the plaintext with another element. This is seen in simple ciphers like the Caesar cipher.
*	Permutation: Rearranging the elements of the plaintext in a systematic way to create diffusion. This helps obscure the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext.
*	Shifting: Moving bits or characters a certain number of places over, commonly used in both classical and modern ciphers.

## Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption
Encryption algorithms are typically divided into two categories: symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

## Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This means that both parties must have access to the shared secret key. Examples include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

## Asymmetric Encryption
Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys, one for encryption (public key) and another for decryption (private key). This method enhances security since the private key is kept secret. Examples include the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) vs RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) serve different purposes in encryption.
*	AES: A symmetric key algorithm that is highly efficient for encrypting large amounts of data. It is widely used across various applications for its speed and security.

*	RSA: An asymmetric key algorithm that is primarily used for securely transmitting data and establishing secure communications. It is typically slower than AES and is often used in conjunction with symmetric key algorithms to ensure secure key exchange.  RSA is based on 2 great mathematicians, Euler’s totient theorem and Fermat’s little theorem, although it is called “little”, indeed it is one of the great theorem in modern math.

## Padding
Padding in encryption is used to ensure that plaintext data conforms to the block size required by the encryption algorithm. Without padding, data that does not meet the block size requirements could lead to incomplete or inaccurate encryption. Common padding schemes include PKCS#7 and Zero Padding.

## CBC and Padding Oracle
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode is a common block cipher mode that uses an initialization vector (IV) and chains the encryption of each block to the previous block. This ensures that identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertext blocks.

However, CBC mode is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, where an attacker can exploit the padding scheme to decrypt ciphertext without knowing the encryption key.  The attacker sends modified ciphertexts to the server and observes the server’s response to determine whether the padding is correct. By systematically altering the ciphertext and analyzing the server’s error messages, the attacker can eventually decipher the entire message. Proper padding validation and error handling are crucial to mitigating this vulnerability.

CBC was also suffered from Timing attack.  By measuring how long it takes for the system to encrypt or decrypt data, an attacker can infer information about the cryptographic keys or the plaintext. This type of attack typically requires many attempts and precise timing measurements, but it can be effective against poorly implemented cryptographic systems. 

## Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)
Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is an advanced mode of operation for symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers. GCM provides both confidentiality and data integrity, making it suitable for secure communication in various applications. Unlike CBC, GCM is resistant to padding oracle attacks and is designed to be highly efficient on hardware.

In conclusion, encryption is a cornerstone of modern data security, employing complex mathematical operations and strict protocols to protect sensitive information. Understanding its basic principles, different methodologies, and potential vulnerabilities is essential for anyone involved in the safeguarding of data.
